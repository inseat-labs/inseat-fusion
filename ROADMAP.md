# Roadmap

All milestones are proposals. Advancement depends on security review and the
preregistered evaluation in [docs/EVALUATION_PLAN.md](docs/EVALUATION_PLAN.md).

## Milestone 0: contracts and dry-run planning

Status: complete as of 2026-09-19. Adapter contracts revalidated
(docs/CLI_CONTRACTS.md); progress-event schema, validator, and fixture-driven
cancellation, timeout, and budget-exhaustion simulations added.

- Freeze task, policy, adapter, event, budget, and ledger schemas.
- Implement static policy selection and explain every selected workflow leg.
- Define Claude Code and Codex adapter contract fixtures without live calls.
- Produce user-visible dry-run plans with estimated limits, not invented costs.
- Validate cancellation, schema drift, and malformed output fixtures.

Exit criterion: deterministic fixtures produce stable plans and provenance with
no process execution or repository mutation.

## Milestone 1: isolated Single workflow

Lineage: emit `version: 1` boundary envelopes for `base -> solver -> verify ->
apply` per [docs/BOUNDARY_LINEAGE.md](docs/BOUNDARY_LINEAGE.md), with digest
continuity checked before atomic application.

- Add a process supervisor with explicit timeout, budget, and cancellation.
- Run one solver in a separate worktree created from an immutable base revision.
- Add deterministic verification and atomic application of one final patch.
- Leave the base unchanged on failure, timeout, cancellation, or failed checks.

Exit criterion: fault-injection tests establish atomicity and cleanup behavior.

## Milestone 2: Cascade and Critique

Lineage: extend envelopes to `critique`, `repair`, and `select`
transformations; add offline replay verification and the ledger `lineage`
block.

- Add deterministic Cascade acceptance and escalation gates.
- Add a read-only critic and one bounded solver repair.
- Record role, provider, model, timing, cost inputs, evidence, and outcome per leg.
- Compare both workflows with the fixed-model baseline.

Exit criterion: held-out evaluation shows a useful tradeoff without weakening
security or adapter parity.

## Milestone 3: evaluation and viability decision

- Run preregistered quality, cost, latency, parity, fault, and bias studies.
- Compare against a fixed model and Quorum on equivalent tasks and budgets.
- Publish failures, exclusions, and uncertainty alongside aggregate results.
- Stop, narrow, or reposition if the stated stop criteria are met.

## Milestone 4: optional Parallel research

- Prototype isolated parallel candidates only after earlier milestones pass.
- Select one candidate through deterministic checks and an evidence judge.
- Do not automatically merge candidate text or patches.
- Re-run the full threat model and evaluation before considering release.

No learned router is planned until static policies have reproducible evidence,
sufficient data, and a separately reviewed learning and rollback design.
